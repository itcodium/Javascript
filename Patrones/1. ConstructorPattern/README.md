## The Constructor Pattern

In classical object-oriented programming languages, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object once memory has been allocated for it. **In JavaScript, as almost everything is an object, we're most often interested in object constructors.**

Object constructors are used to create specific types of objects - both preparing the object for use and accepting arguments which a constructor can use to set the values of member properties and methods when the object is first created.
